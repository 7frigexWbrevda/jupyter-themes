But what makes The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows so special and appealing? Well, according to the author, John Koenig, his goal is to "create beautiful new words that we need but do not yet have". He believes that language is not only a tool for communication, but also a way of exploring and expressing our inner worlds. He draws inspiration from various sources, such as ancient languages, mythology, philosophy, psychology, art, and science. He also invents words that reflect the modern condition, such as "vemÃ¶dalen", the frustration of taking a photograph of something amazing when thousands of identical photos already exist.
 
The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows is not only a book of words, but also a book of stories. Each word is accompanied by a collage of images and a short essay that illustrates its meaning and context.

They invite the reader to imagine different perspectives and experiences, and to connect with their own emotions. The book also features beautiful illustrations by artist Maria Popova that enhance the visual appeal and mood of the book.
